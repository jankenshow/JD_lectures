This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rgl/versions/0.97.0/topics/planes3d
open3d()
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
z <- 0.2*x - 0.3*y
fit <- lm(z ~ x + y)
plot3d(x, y, z, type = "s", col = "red", size = 1)

coefs <- coef(fit)
a <- coefs["x"]
b <- coefs["y"]
c <- -1
d <- coefs["(Intercept)"]

planes3d(a, b, c, d, alpha = 0.5)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
